# Data_Analysis_Forecasting_YouTube_Views
This project uses Excel's built-in Forecasting Tool to predict YouTube views based on historical data. Confidence intervals of 85% and 75% are applied to assess the accuracy of the predictions. The tool automatically selects the appropriate forecasting model, simplifying the forecasting process for data analysis in data science projects.

##Objective:
Primary Goal: Use Excel's built-in forecasting tool to predict future YouTube views based on historical data.
Confidence Interval Application: Apply 85% and 75% confidence intervals to assess the accuracy and reliability of the predictions.
Data Analysis: Simplify the forecasting process, making it accessible for data analysis in data science projects without the need for advanced modeling.
