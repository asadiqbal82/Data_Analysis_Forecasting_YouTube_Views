# Data Analysis & Forecasting YouTube Views

This project demonstrates how to use Excel's built-in Forecasting Tool to predict future YouTube views based on historical data. It leverages statistical modeling and confidence intervals to assess the accuracy of the predictions. The tool automatically selects the most appropriate forecasting model, making the forecasting process easier and more efficient for data analysis in data science projects.


## Features

•	Historical Data Input: The project uses historical YouTube views data to predict future trends.

•	Excel's Forecasting Tool: Utilizes Excel's built-in forecasting capabilities to predict future views.

•	Confidence Intervals: 85% and 75% confidence intervals are applied to assess the reliability and accuracy of the predictions.

•	Automated Model Selection: Excel automatically chooses the best forecasting model (e.g., exponential smoothing, linear regression) based on the data provided.

•	Data Visualization: The project includes visual charts to help analyze the trends and forecast results.


## Technologies Used

•	Microsoft Excel (For forecasting and analysis).

•	Excel's Forecasting Tool (For automatic model selection and predictions)

## How to Use

•	Prepare Historical Data: Ensure you have historical YouTube views data, ideally in a time series format (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

•	Open the Excel File: Open the provided Excel file that contains the data and forecasting tool.

•	Run Forecasting: Use the built-in Forecasting tool in Excel to apply the prediction model to the data.

•	Adjust Confidence Intervals: Choose between 85% and 75% confidence intervals based on the level of prediction certainty you require.

•	Analyze Results: Visualize the forecasted data and assess the accuracy of the predictions using the confidence intervals.
