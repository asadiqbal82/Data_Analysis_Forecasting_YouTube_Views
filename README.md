# Data_Analysis_Forecasting_YouTube_Views
This project uses Excel's built-in Forecasting Tool to predict YouTube views based on historical data. Confidence intervals of 85% and 75% are applied to assess the accuracy of the predictions. The tool automatically selects the appropriate forecasting model, simplifying the forecasting process for data analysis in data science projects.
